Plugin Support Comments allows you to pull in comments from a plugin support forum to a page/post comments. This means any threads started in a support forum are added to your WP comments as well, hopefully meaning you can keep better track of them!

== Description ==

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `plugin-support-comments` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory keeping the file structure.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Edit or add a new post or page and you will see a new meta box to add your plugin slug
